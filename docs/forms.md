All form controls takes `value` and `onChange`.
Whatever you using: Input, Select, Checkbox, etc.
`onChange` triggers with 2 arguments:
 1. **Changed value**
 2. **Event**.

We are trying provide native event from any custom control like `Switcher` with native control, for example
`Switcher` has `<input type="checkbox">` under the hood.
